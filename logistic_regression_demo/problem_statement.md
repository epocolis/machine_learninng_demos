## Problem Statement
Imagine we are running a web service, and we want to predict the root cause of incidents when they occur. We have identified three common root causes:

- CPU Overload
- Memory Leak
- Network Issues


We'll collect multiple metrics from our system:

- CPU Usage (%)
- Memory Usage (%)
- Disk I/O
- Network Latency (ms)
